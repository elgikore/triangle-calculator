This app was made as part of the requirement for CPE1130 Programming Logic and Design back in October 2021. The source code can be chaotic as it was the time where classes (and the entire concept of object-oriented programming in general) isn't taught to me yet and at the time I didn't know how to create a separate file where the code actually works on the main C# file, so all the code is stored under one file. Looking back, I still enjoyed making this mini-project even with the aforementioned issues.

This application calculates triangle-related problems (specificaly relating to area, perimeter, and some trigonometry) such as:
* Area of a triangle
* SAS Formula for the Area of a Triangle
* Heron's Formula
* Area of an Equilateral Triangle
* Area of an Isosceles Triangle without Given Height
* Perimeter of a triangle
* Pythagorean Theorem
* Law of Sines
* Law of Cosines

# How to install
1. Make sure you have [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1) or higher (since it uses C# 8.0).
2. Click the latest version on the Releases section and download the source code. Alternatively, click the green code button and download as a ZIP (or you can clone it).
3. Open your favorite code editor of your choice (Visual Studio is more recommended than VS Code).
4. Open the solution file and then run (Visual Studio) or open the folder of the project and then run the Program.cs file (VS Code and other code editors).
   * You can also launch it from the terminal but make sure you use Roslyn as the [compiler](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31875825/how-to-run-roslyn-instead-csc-exe-from-command-line).
6. Enjoy!
